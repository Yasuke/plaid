This is a Haskell library for interacting with [plaid.com](https://plaid.com) api.

It utilizes some of the nice ideas presented in the [GDP](https://kataskeue.com/gdp.pdf) paper and in general tries to stay out of your way and let you issue plaid.com api calls easily.

You should check out the [/examples/Main.hs](https://github.com/v0d1ch/plaid/blob/master/examples/Main.hs) to see some of the examples of using
the lib.

#### Contributing


I encourage you to play with the library, open up issues, get yourself involved.

Plan is to build nice documentation with helpful examples.

I don't have specific code style guidelines, just follow the code style that you
already see. 

There is a stylish-haskell.yaml file in the root and it would be nice if you can configure your editor to use it.

Please squash your commits into one when issuing a PR so we keep a nice git timeline.
